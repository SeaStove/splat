##Overview

Splat is a video game mod based off the game ["Aricraft Controller"](http://sourceforge.net/projects/atcj/). This project was completed using pure java, with minimal additional libraries.

##About

Airtraffic Control is a game in which the player guides airplanes to safely land at an airport. This modification uses much of the same logic, but the role of the player is completely different. In Splat, the player must 'zap' bugs before they reach a piece of pie. The zapping mechanic works by inputting the column and row (numbers, then letters) that the player wants to zap.

##Installation
Files listed in the repository are configured for use in the eclipse IDE, running this game from eclipse would be easiest. To install, download the repo and import into eclipse. Simply compile and run, no extra libraries should be needed to run the game.
